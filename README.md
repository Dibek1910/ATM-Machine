# ATM-Machine

This project is an implementation of an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) machine using Java programming language. The ATM machine simulates the basic functionalities of a real ATM, allowing users to perform various banking operations such as withdrawing cash, depositing cash, checking account balance, and changing the PIN.


**Features**

1.User Authentication: The ATM machine requires users to input their unique PIN to access their accounts. It validates the PIN against the stored account information to ensure security.

2.Account Operations:
Cash Withdrawal: Users can withdraw a specific amount from their accounts, ensuring the withdrawal does not exceed their available balance.
Cash Deposit: Users can deposit cash into their accounts, updating their balance accordingly.
Account Balance Inquiry: Users can check their account balance to view the current amount available.
PIN Change: Users can change their PIN to enhance account security.

3.Transaction Logging: The ATM machine maintains a transaction log that records all the banking operations performed by users. This log can be used for auditing purposes or reference.

4.Error Handling: The ATM machine handles various error scenarios, such as incorrect PIN entry, insufficient funds for withdrawal, or invalid inputs. It provides appropriate error messages to guide users.



**Technologies Used**

Java: The project is developed using the Java programming language, making use of its object-oriented features and libraries.



**Future Enhancements**

This project can be further enhanced by incorporating additional features such as:

1.Account creation: Allow new users to create accounts and store their information securely.

2.Transfer funds: Enable users to transfer money between different accounts or to other users.
